## Compile with gulp

If you don't have gulp yet run this command for installing it globally
```
npm install -g gulp
```

After you have done this just run this command 
```
gulp
```
Now gulp will compile serveral things and make a new dir called `public` this is where the magic happens you now see all scripts / less files are compiled into 1 single file.

If you have errors with installing npm modules try to run it with `sudo`
